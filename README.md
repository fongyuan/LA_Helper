Current commands:

The idea is that the next bid will not be worth it since it will reduce that bidders gold split.


/raid  
Sends images of common raid strategies based on the drop down choices


/hone  
The user chooses the gear type (ie. legendary, relic, ancient, etc..), the target ilvl and whether it is an armor or weapon.
